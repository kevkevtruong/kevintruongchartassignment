<p class="article">A survey released earlier this year shows a growing number of millennials are uncomfortable in personal situations with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people.</p>

<p class="article">The survey released by the media watchdog group GLAAD included responses from 1,970 adults in the United States ages 18 and older -- including 1,754 individuals who identified as non-LGBTQ.</p>

<p class="article">Respondents were asked how comfortable they were in personal situations with LGBTQ people -- such as learning that a family member is LGBTQ. Among respondents ages 18 to 34, the survey showed an increase in discomfort when compared to the previous two years.</p>

<p class="article">Mariano Ruiz serves on the board of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. He said the trend could be a product of more divisive discourse from political leaders.</p>

<p class="article">"The rhetoric from politicians always hits at some point the population," said Ruiz. "Not only older people but younger as well."</p>
